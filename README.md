Installing as a direct, dev or peer dependency is up to the user installing the package.

### Design Token CSS Custom Property dependency

The use of any Auro custom element has a dependency on the [Auro Design Tokens](https://auro.alaskaair.com/getting-started/developers/design-tokens).

### CSS Custom Property fallbacks

[CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) are [not supported](https://auro.alaskaair.com/support/custom-properties) in older browsers. For this, fallback properties are pre-generated and included with the npm.

Any update to the Auro Design Tokens will be immediately reflected with browsers that support CSS custom properties, legacy browsers will require updated components with pre-generated fallback properties.

### Define dependency in project component

Defining the component dependency within each component that is using the `<auro-datetime>` component.

```javascript
import "@aurodesignsystem/auro-datetime";
```

**Reference component in HTML**

```html
<auro-datetime type="date"></auro-datetime>
```

## CDN Use

In cases where the project is not able to process JS assets, there are pre-processed assets available for use.

### Install

Include the following example HTML code in the `<head>` element of your page.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@aurodesignsystem/design-tokens@latest/dist/tokens/CSSCustomProperties.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@aurodesignsystem/webcorestylesheets@latest/dist/bundled/essentials.css" />

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@aurodesignsystem/auro-datetime@latest/dist/auro-datetime__bundled.js" type="module"></script>
```

**NOTE:** Be sure to replace `@latest` in the URL with the version of the asset you want. @latest is NOT aware of any MAJOR releases, use at your own risk.

### CDN options

Both [Unpkg](https://www.unpkg.com/) and [JSDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) are free open source options that you can use. These are 3rd party resources and Auro is not responsible for their uptime. **Use at your own risk.** These bundle resources are included with the npm package, you are free to use any CDN resource that fits your needs.
